The `useReducer` hook is a powerful React feature used to manage complex state logic in functional components. It's an alternative to `useState`, especially when state transitions rely on specific actions.

---

## 📌 When Should You Use `useReducer`?

- You need **more structured state transitions**
- State updates are **based on conditions or action types**
- Multiple pieces of state are **interrelated**
- You're building **multi-step forms, counters, toggle systems, or apps with undo/redo functionality**

---

## 🛠 Syntax

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducerFunction, initialState);
```

- **`state`**: current state
- **`dispatch`**: function to trigger updates
- **`reducerFunction`**: determines how the state updates
- **`initialState`**: starting value of the state

## ⚙️ Benefits of Using `useReducer`

- Keeps your state logic organized
- Ideal for applications with **many state transitions**
- Easier to manage than multiple `useState` hooks in complex components
- Prepares you for using `Redux` (similar reducer pattern)

## 🧠 Pro Tip

You can separate your reducer logic into its own file for better scalability and testing.
